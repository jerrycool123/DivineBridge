If you are a server moderator, you can view the **Moderator Tutorial** to learn how to add a membership role.\n\n<u>**Auth Mode**</u>\n\n> You need to verify your membership every month.\n\n1. Go to Divine Bridge's [website](https://divine-bridge.jerrycool123.com/) and click the \"Sign in\" button and sign in with your Discord account.\n\n2. Go to the [dashboard](https://divine-bridge.jerrycool123.com/dashboard) and click the \"Apply\" button of the membership role yo u would like to apply.\n\n3. Click the \"Sign in with Google\" button and link your YouTube account.\n\n4. Click the \"Verify\" button to verify your membership.\n\n📝 **Important Note**\n\nOnce you are verified, you don't have to do this again every month.\nDivine Bridge will automatically renew your membership duration.\n\nThis mode involves some <u>cyber security & privacy</u> concern.\n**You are strongly recommended to learn more about this in the \"Why Divine Bridge\" section on the [website](https://divine-bridge.jerrycool123.com/).**\n\n<u>**Screenshot Mode**</u>\n\n> You need to sign in with YouTube and verify your membership once.\n\n1. Please use `/verify` command in the server where you want to apply the membership role.\n\n⭐️ **[Recommended]** Each membership role has a Alias Command. When you use the alias command, you don't have to specify the membership role you want to verify anymore.\nYou can use `/help` command and select `Command List` to view the alias commands in a server.\n\n2. Go to [Purchases and Memberships](https://www.youtube.com/paid_memberships) and take a screenshot.\n\nThe screenshot should include the following information:\n- The YouTube channel name of the membership\n- Your name\n- The next billing date\n\n3. Submit your verification request and wait for moderators approval.\n\nServer moderators will receive your membership verification request. Once approved, Divine Bridge will assign the membership role to you and notify you.\n\n📝 **Important Note**\n\nEvery month, <u>1 day</u> before the expiry of your membership, Divine Bridge will notify you that you need to send a screenshot of your new billing date, you have <u>24 Hours</u> to do so.",

Use `/set-log-channel` command to set the log channel for Divine Bridge.\n\nPlease make sure that the log channel is a private channel, only accessible by server moderators.\n\nNote that the bot requires to view the log channel, send messages, and embed links.\n\n2. Use `/add-role` command to add a YouTube membership role to the server.\n\nYou need to create a Discord role first in the server. Besides, the highest role of the bot must be **higher** than the membership role in the role hierarchy, in order to manage the membership role.\n\nYou need to provide an **alias command** name for the membership role. This is a command name that users can use to verify their membership easier. When using the alias command, the corresponding membership role will be automatically selected, and the user will not need to select the membership role they want to verify again.\n\n3. Handle the membership verification requests in the log channel.\n\nWhen a user uses the **Screenshot Mode** to verify their membership, the bot will send a message to the⁠ server's log channel.\n\nYou can **Approve** ✅, **Reject** ❌, or **Modify** 📝 the verification request."
